//That's the output structure for the search algorithms.
//The task of the pathfinder is to fill it in a right way.

//Practically, after SearchResult is filled by the path finding algorithm,
//one may invoke XMLogger methods like writeToLogSummary etc.
//(passing appropriate fields of SearchResult as parameters)
//and these methods will flush the data to the XML.

//lppath is a path that is a sequence of nodes, corresponding to adjacent cells on the grid.
//It's a natural path for Dijkstra, A*, JPS (e.g. these algorithms find this sort of path).

//hppath is a path that is a sequence of nodes NOT necessarily adjacent on the grid. It's like a path composed of the sections.
//It's a natural path for Theta*.

//In general one might want all algorithms to fill BOTH sorts of path (so both lppath and hppath will be flushed to output log).

//Theta* naturally generates hppath and one needs to post-process it to additionally create lppath.
//One might realize this post-proccessing step by sequentially invoking Line-Of-Sight function that was used during the search.
//NB: In such case the length of the lppath will be formally different form the length of hppath (which is stored as 'SearchResult.pathlength'

// A*-JPS-Dijkstra-etc. naturally generate lppath. One might post-process it by skipping the nodes at which
//the movement direction does not change to form sections of hppath. In this case length of the hppath always equals
//the length of the lppath.
